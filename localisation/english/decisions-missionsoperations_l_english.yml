french_communist_protest:0 "Growing Communist Protest"
french_communist_protest_desc:0 "As Germany launches Fall Gelb and pushes through Belgium and the Netherlands, communist protests erupt across France, gaining momentum with each passing day. In Paris, Lyon, and Marseille, workers flood the streets, waving red banners and chanting against the government’s failures and the capitalist system they blame for the war. Factories slow as strikes spread, and underground communist cells organize rallies calling for peace, solidarity with the Soviet Union, and a workers’ revolution. The French authorities scramble to contain the unrest, fearing that internal dissent could fracture the nation just as German forces threaten its borders."
french_communist_revolution:0 "Coming Communist Revolution"
french_communist_revolution_desc:0 "As Germany unleashes Fall Rot and Wehrmacht forces break through the French defensive lines, southern France begins to boil with revolutionary fervor. In cities like Toulouse and Marseille, communist militias emerge from the shadows, seizing local government buildings and proclaiming workers' councils in defiance of the collapsing French Republic. Armed with looted weapons and driven by anger at years of inequality and war, thousands rally under red banners, calling for the creation of a socialist state. The countryside echoes with the sound of gunfire and chants of revolution, as the south slips from government control and a new order begins to take shape amid the chaos of national defeat."

soviet_invasion_of_china_desc:0 "In the shadowed halls of the Kremlin, Soviet strategists pore over maps of Sinkiang, their fingers tracing rail lines and river valleys as they finalize Operatsiya Vostok. As Japan bleeds China dry in the east, Moscow sees its chance—an opportunity cloaked in chaos. The Red Army masses along the border, not to confront Japan directly, but to slice into China's war-torn north and carve out a buffer state, one that will march to the rhythm of Marx and Lenin. The plan is simple: move swiftly, install loyal cadres, and declare a 'Soviet Chinese Republic', a Soviet-aligned bastion meant to outflank both Chiang and the Japanese Empire."
